#### This repository contains the coding resources to reproduce the results presented in the manuscript "Benchmarking DNA isolation kits used in analyses of the urinary microbiome".  

The raw fastq files for this study can be found on the SRA under accession number PRJNA662669 [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?linkname=bioproject_sra_all&from_uid=662669)

The analyses are divided into 2 sections:

1. Analyses to assess how the DNA kits performed on urine samples
2. Analyses to assess how the DNA kits performed on a mock microbial community dilution series
